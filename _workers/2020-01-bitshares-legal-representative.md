# Preface前言

In 2019 the community was offered two choices for the legal representative work: merely a mandate for passive representation, or paid per month to allow proactive actions as well.
This seemed reasonable at that time, it is not reasonable now. Even the passive roles needed a lot of time and effort. Thus, this worker asks for a monthly fee.
2019年提供给社区两个可供选择的法律代表工作提案：一个是被动的代表任务，一个是积极的代表行动（需要每月支出费用）。
在当时看来是合理的，但是现在却不然。即使是被动角色仍然需要付出大量时间与精力。因此，这项提案需要月度支出。
Among the tasks of the legal representative is to deal with listing agreements, defend against delisting from existing exchanges.
法律代表的任务之一是处理交易所上架及下架问题。
We seek to extend our position as legal representative in case the community wants us to do so.
我们也会努力按照社区要求拓展我们的法律代表范围。
All existing legal agreements must be considered void if the BitShares Blockchain Foundation is no longer the legal representative for the BitShares Blockchain, with all consequences that come with it (effective date 31st January 2020).
如果BBF不再是BitShares区块链的法律代表，所有现存的法律协定必须被认为是无效的，及所有由其带来的后果（截止日期2020-01-31）。

# Introduction说明

The strength of BitShares Blockchain is its technical superiority and distributed governance. However, due to the nature of its decentralized and [autonomous] character, some aspects are not continuously attended in comparison to most other blockchain platforms. One of those aspects is dealing with legal issues and regulations. For example in 2018, the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) engaged with PaulHastings LLP for the Legal Opinion Letter about the legal status of the core native token BTS, dealt with Bittrex Inc., Huobi and other exchange listings, and organized BitFest. Legal issues like this are not static in our space, and require ongoing maintenance. The legal opinion letter about BTS obtained early 2018 would require updating today because new regulatory guidance has been provided by various regulatory agencies worldwide. To make things like this possible, somebody or an entity needs to carry the authority (mandate) to sign on behalf of the community. Keep in mind that such an entity or person can only represent the BTS holders and BitShares community with an approved mandate.
BitShares区块链的优势是它的领先的技术及去中心化治理。然而，由于去中心化及自主治理的特性，许多方面不能持续性与其它大多数区块链平台做竞争。处理法律问题及条款就是其中之一。例如2018年，BBF与普衡律师事务所接触处理关于BTS核心代币的法律形态的法律意见书，及Bittrex Inc., Huobi等其它交易所的上架问题，并组织了BitFest。法律问题在现实中并不是一个静止的问题，它需要持续的维护。早于2018年的BTS法律意见书在今天都需要更新，因为世界范围内的监管机构提出了很多新的监管规定。为了能够确实可行，某人或者某个实体需要获得权限（授权）来代表社区进行签字。需要注意的是，这样的实体或者个人仅能够代表BTS持有者及BitShares社区，而且必须要获得BTS持有者及BitShares社区的批准授权。

# Proposal提案

We here propose to appoint the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF), to engage in external communication as the
only legal representative with authorities, market parties and legal counsel.
With the mandate as the Legal Representative, the BBF will be the single point of contact for legal (authority) matters,
as well as (temporary) contractual obligations to fulfil other worker proposals. We seek to extend our position as
legal representative in case the community wants us to do so. The BBF will
coordinate and distribute legal work
and act as legal representative on behalf of the BTS token holders. If needed, the BBF may sign on behalf of the
Community taking advice from approved members of the BitShares Committee.
我们在此提议委任BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF)，作为唯一的法律代表从事与政府、市场各方及法律顾问的外部沟通。
有了作为法律代表的授权，BBF将会是法律（权限）事务的单一联系人，及（临时）实现其它工作提案的合同义务。我们也会努力按照社区要求拓展我们的法律代表范围。BBF将会作为法律代表维护BTS代币持有人利益来进行法律工作。如果需要，BBF可以以社区的名义听取来自于BitShares理事会确认的成员的建议并进行签字。


Among the tasks are dealing with listing agreements, defend against delisting from existing exchanges and other parties
requesting the legal opinion letter or legal questions on BitAssets for all kinds of purposes (e.g. Huobi, LATOKEN, Lykke,
Binance and Bittrex), or also among the tasks is acting as a legal entity for Huobi, LATOKEN, Lykke,
Binance and Bittrex (e.g. licensing for Apple Connect for
the mobile worker).
其中之一的任务是处理交易所上架下架协议及其它团体要求的法律意见书或者BitAssets所有用途的法律问题(例如Huobi, LATOKEN, Lykke,
Binance and Bittrex), 也可能的任务之一是作为一个对接Huobi, LATOKEN、Lykke、Binance and Bittrex的法律实体（例如Apple授权连接或移动提案）。

Acting as a representative, we feel obligated to always represent BitShares Blockchain publicly in the best interest of its
token holders. Since legal agreements are binding in the real world, while worker proposals can be revoked quickly, we here
propose a mandate for a 12 month duration.
The daily BTS payout will be set to collect the necessary funds quickly to secure the funding. The mandate is considered
given when the monthly fee is paid,
and revoked if the monthly fee can't be paid in full anymore.
作为一个代表，我们有责任一直作为BitShares区块链的公开代表，以维护BTS核心代币持有者的最大利益。法律协定在现实世界中是有约束力的，但是工作提案却可以被快速撤销，因为我们在此提议一个持续12个月的授权。
每日拨款将会设置为能够快速的募集必要的资金数量以保证资金支持。当月度付款拨付后，授权将会认为生效。

It is essential that the BBF will continue to have the legal mandate, otherwise existing contracts become void. Invalidation of existing contracts may result in BTS being delisted from exchanges.
BBF持续的得到法律授权是非常必要的，否则现有合同将会失效。现有合同的失效可能会导致BTS从交易所下架。

In short, this worker proposal comes with two options:
简短来说，此工作提案由两个选项：

- **No approval**: The BBF will not obtain the extension of its mandate and will have to withdraw from all existing legal agreements
- **未批准**:BBF将不会获得授权延长，并将退出现存的所有法律协定。
- **Approval given, worker active**: The mandate is granted and considered funded as long as the monthly fee can be paid
- **批准通过，提案生效**:给予授权并拨付预算资金，月度拨款后生效。
Furthermore, authorities and businesses require a point of contact with legal mandate. Otherwise, the community may face
(uninformed) decisions made by third parties due to lack of communication with a community representative with legal mandate.
此外, 政府和企业需要一个法律授权作为一个切入点。另外，社区可能会因为缺失有法律授权的社区代表的沟通渠道，而面对由第三方做出的（非正式）的决定。
# Remark备注

 - There can be only one legal representative for the BitShares Blockchain as authorities have a need for one channel.
 - The deadline to approve the BBF as the legal representative (aka the worker becomes active) is the 31st of January 2020.
The mandate as Legal Representative comes with responsibilities and liabilities. In the case that no mandate will be granted
until the deadline, the BBF has to actively withdraw from any agreements made and inform all counterparties. That step is
irreversible and also can't be undone if the worker would become active at a later time again.
 - BitShares区块链需仅有一个法律代表，并拥有沟通渠道的权限。（？？？）
 - 批准BBF作为法律代表（只要提案激活）的截止日期是2020-01-31.
 授权作为法律代表意味着责任与义务。截止日期如果没有得到授权，BBF必须主动退出任何达成的协议并通知所有合作方。即使工作提案在稍后的日期被激活，此步骤仍不可逆并将不能撤销。

# Fee 费用

Everyone's time is valuable. As such, we are asking for funding though the BitShares Blockchain Reserves and seek a fixed monthly fee of 2000 EUR for the next 12 months,
payable from January 1st 2020 until December 31st 2020. Invoices will be provided publicly through the [accounting website](https://workers.bitshares.foundation/).
The fee only covers the hours spent by the entire team to subjects related only to this mandate. Travel expenses or fees of 3rd parties (i.e. lawyers, notaries, etc)
are not included, and need to be funded separately. The payment of this fee will happen preferably in bitEUR, but may also happen in any alternative BitAsset,
BTS directly, or in BTC depending on market conditions. The value indicated here and on later invoices represent FIAT values, and will be paid in equivalent value
of the chosen crypto-currency. This worker carries no escrow fee.
每个人的时间都很宝贵。所以，我们请求从BitShares资金池中拨款并寻求一个修正月度费用 2000 EUR，为期12个月。
支付时间从2020-01-01到2020-12-31。发票将通过[accounting website](https://workers.bitshares.foundation/)公开提供。
费用仅包含整个团队被授权的关联项目的小时费用。旅行费用及第三方团体的费用（例如：律师，公证，此类）不在其中，并需要单独拨款。费用拨付优先考虑bitEUR,也可考虑其它Bitasset，直接BTS，或者BTC（取决于市场条件）。此处及之后的发票代表的是真实法币价值，支付按照换算价格支付。此提案没有托管费用。
The daily BTS payout is set to 14.723 BTS, which contains a devaluation multiplier of 3. In theory, if the price remains the same and the worker is voted active, it will
take 4 months to collect the budget for the whole year.
日拨款为14.723 BTS，其包含了货币贬值的乘数系数 3。理论上，如果现在bts价格维持不变，提案激活，大概需要4个月就可以获得全年的预算。
